            <h2>1 | INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <h3>1.1 | Summary</h3>
            <p>The CW:P Medical System consists of six status effects: bleeding, pain, fractured, unconscious,
                overdosed, and critical state...</p>
            <h3>1.2 | Status Effects</h3>
            <p>As of September 19, 2025, there are four main ways to receive these status effects. The most common cause
                is when a player is shot. The second cause is through fall damage, the third cause is when
                occupying an exploding vehicle, and the fourth is by a lightsaber.

            <ol>
                <li>Critical State - 30% chance to occur once your blood reaches 0
                    No medical aid can be rendered
                    Can be fixed by having a second person place you into a bacta tank</li>


                <br>
                <li>Bleeds - Chance to occur when getting shot or caught in a vehicle explosion. Guaranteed to occur
                    when
                    downed.
                    <br>
                    Light Bleed
                    • 40s before you bleed out & die/enter critical state.
                    Medium Bleed
                    • 25s before you bleed out & die/enter critical state
                    High Bleed
                    • [Unknown]
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Pain - Chance to occur when getting shot or caught in a vehicle explosion. Guaranteed to occur when
                    downed or taking
                    fall damage. Pain slowly disappears on its own once bleeding status has been cleared.

                    Light Pain
                    • 12-20 seconds before it disappears
                    Medium Pain
                    • 14-16 seconds before it disappears
                    High Pain
                    • Caused by severe fall damage
                    • Often associated with unconsciousness
                    • ~26 seconds before it disappears</li>
                <br>


                <li>Fractured - Guaranteed to occur when taking fall damage greater than ~65 studs. Chance to occur when
                    hit
                    with a
                    lightsaber

                    • Disables Sprinting and Rolling; increasing walkspeed by ~314%</li>
                <br>
                <li>Consciousness - Defines whether you’re active or downed.
                    Conscious
                    • Starting status for every trooper
                    • Allows you to use equipment and medical supplies.
                    Unconscious
                    • Occurs when your health has reached 0
                    • Does not allow you to use equipment or medical supplies
                    • Receiving damage while downed results in death, bypassing the critical state and blood system</li>
                <br>
                <li>Overdosed - Occurs when a player intakes more than 5 Synthnull Tablets
                    • Can be fixed with a secondary person providing a stimpack</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>2 | CONTROLS</h2>
            <h3>2.1 | Using a Bacta Tank</h3>
            <p>Walking up to a Bacta Tank will display a hold E to enter prompt. Upon holding E, you will enter the
                Bacta Tank,
                disabling your equipment, and removing any injuries/status effects. To exit, you must press E and wait a
                few seconds
                while an animation plays. It is recommended to use a Bacta Tank if available to conserve your supplies.
                You can place
                others into Bacta Tanks as long as you are carrying them. Location of where to find Bacta Tanks is
                unknown.
            </p>
            <div class="image-slot"><img src="info4.png" alt="" class="kep"></div>
            <h3>2.2 | Carrying</h3>
            <p>Pressing V when a downed (unconscious) player is nearby attaches the downed player’s character model to
                the back of the
                carrier. Facing your camera forward while carrying someone accesses your medical menu, facing backwards
                accesses their
                menu. This mechanic allows you to render aid while transporting a downed player. Similarly, a third
                person can access a
                downed player's menu while they are being carried as long as they’re nearby. However, the delay caused
                by moving while
                carrying someone causes you to exit the downed player’s menu. A downed player can be placed in an open
                LAAT if they are
                being carried. If the downed player is in a critical state, they must be taken to a Bacta Tank, where
                they can be placed
                inside. To drop someone you are carrying, press V.</p>
            <h3>2.3 | Opening the Medical Menu</h3>
            <p>Pressing U opens the CW:P medical menu, the appearance and functionality is a simplified version of the
                ACS “Mopmed”
                system. Pressing U within 4 studs of another character opens the medical menu for said player. Because
                of this, if more
                than 1 player is nearby, it may become difficult to access their menu. Therefore, ask them to separate
                themselves out
                from other players if you need to administer aid. If there are multiple people downed next to each
                other, carry one away
                and administer aid while another person aids the other downed player. If you are downed, you are not
                able to open the
                medical menu.
            </p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>3 | UI</h2>
            <h3>3.1 | Overview Window</h3>
            <p>Opening the medical menu reveals 3 windows to help administer aid to either yourself or another player.
                The first
                window, titled “Overview”, contains: the username of the patient, the blood level, health, and status
                effects (upon
                receiving damage). When hurt, your health bar will decrease depending on the lethality of the weapon.
                For a standard
                trooper, most weapons will not down them in one shot. Depending on the situation, you may receive a
                status effect. If
                you receive bleeding as a status effect, your blood level will begin to decrease. Blood regenerates once
                your health has
                reached at least 50%. Below is an image of the medical menu.</p>
            <div class="image-slot"><img src="info3.png" alt="" class="kep"></div>
            <h3>3.2 | Equipment Window</h3>
            <p>The middle window, titled “Equipment”, simply lists the amount of medical supplies that remain in the
                player’s
                inventory. This list is purely visual, it has no functionality aside from representing your remaining
                supplies. The
                starting quantity for all personnel is zero. You can obtain supplies through the “ . Below is an image
                of the medical
                menu.
            </p>
            <div class="image-slot"><img src="info2.png" alt="" class="kep"></div>
            <h3>3.3 | Examine and Treat Window</h3>
            <p>The rightmost window, titled “Examine and Treat” is where medical items are used by left-clicking the
                corresponding
                icon. When an item is used, the progress bar at the bottom indicates when the process is done. An item
                is consumed when
                the icon is clicked, not when the process is completed. Because of this mechanic, if you exit the range
                of another
                player’s medical menu after clicking an icon. The item will be gone until you re-enter the range of the
                other player,
                after which it will be applied to the player. Below is an image of the medical menu outlining the name
                of each icon.

            <h2>6 | FIRST AID & CHARACTER MECHANICS</h2>
            <h3>6.1 | Reviving a Downed Player</h3>
            <p>To tell when a player is downed, their character model will either ragdoll, or their lower half will sink
                into the
                ground. Upon opening their menu, they will have the following status: Medium Bleed, Unconscious, Light
                Pain, any
                pre-existing status effects, 0 health, and a decreasing blood level. Before aid can be administered to a
                downed player,
                it is vital to ensure the safety of your surroundings. Bleeding is the primary concern, the person
                administering aid
                should stop the bleeding before anything else. Once it is stopped, if the area is becoming more
                hazardous, the player
                should carry the downed player to a safer area. Otherwise, administer a stimpack. If the downed player
                is low on blood
                (less than 10%), provide a Bacta Bag before using a stimpack. Once the player has revived, instruct them
                to heal the
                rest of their status effects. If the bleeding is not stopped in time and the player enters a critical
                state, they must
                be taken to a Bacta Tank as soon as possible. It is important to note if a Bacta Tank is available, it
                should be used
                after stopping the bleeding.
            </p>
            <h3>6.2 | Fall Damage Mechanics</h3>
            <p>Ladders do not stop fall damage, catching yourself on a ladder will temporarily prevent the damage.
                However, climbing
                down and touching the ground will cause all the damage to be received. Climbing up will prevent the
                damage from being
                taken. Rolling does not prevent fall damage. Fall damage is calculated based on your velocity and travel
                distance,
                jumping prematurely in a moving vehicle will cause heavy damage.
